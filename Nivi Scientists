    <h2>Fasciating Discoveries in the Life of a Nivi Scientist</h2>
    <div>
      <p>After working night and day for months on end, it seems the Nivi Scientists have come up with a breakthrough.</p>
      <p>In a press release tonight on Discord, Nivi himself stated:
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <div>
        <p4><em>"well first, we made a discovery concerning the failed 'shlash'
          <br>
          <br>
          the shlash is not an action, instead it is more of a describing word for the most intense of shorgies"
          <br>
          <br>
          </p4></em>
        <p>The company promised to        completely revolutionize shleeshing as we know it, potentially skyrocketing stock prices in the process.
          <br>
          <br>
        </p>
        <p4><em>"so for example, you could say 'wow, what a shlash' after some intense shleeshing in bradley's closet
          <br>
          <br>
          so that means the elusive 'fifth shleesh' is still out there. and let me tell you, oh boy, is it better than simply tearing someone's shoulders violently apart
          <br>
          <br>
          shleem"
          <br>
          <br>
          </p4></em>
        <p>Nivi told investors at the press meeting.
          <br>
          <br>
        </p>
        <p4><em>"there are two key things at play here
          <br>
          <br>
          first, the 'shleesm'
          <br>
          <br>
          second, the gish glands themselves
          <br>
          <br>
          it, of course, starts with a shlarsh
          <br>
          <br>
          you do all the steps, but after the shoulder glove, instead of shlooshing, you must rip the shoulder apart and get to the gish gland
          <br>
          <br>
          then, you violently shleesh the gish gland with the shoulder glove arm, building up friction and static electricity
          <br>
          <br>
          it gets hotter and hotter, and the electricity builds up until the gish glands temporarily merge into one, the gish inside turning into plasma
          <br>
          <br>
          The explosion is so powerful that everyone in a 100 foot to 1 mile radius inhales the gish plasma explosion and they themselves explode, smaller and smaller cluster explosions going out
          <br>
          <br>
          of course, everyone dies due to the gish"
          <br>
          <br>
          </p4></em>
        <p>Most investors and analysts were immediatly sold, and most reported never before hearing something so HOT. The real promise for most investors however, was in the final product.
          <br>
          <br>
        </p>
        <p4><em>"but at the very center of the shleesmnova, a small chunk of 100% pure dense gish cheese is created"
          <br>
          <br>
          </em></p4>
        <p>Almost immediately, the NSCF stock went up 32%, with future projections for the company rising further from there. 
          <br>
          <br>
          This has been Shloomberg news, thank you for tuning in.
